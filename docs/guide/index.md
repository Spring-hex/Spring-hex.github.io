# Guide

This section provides comprehensive guides covering the core concepts and practices of Spring-Hex. These guides will help you understand the architectural patterns, configuration options, and workflows that Spring-Hex implements.

## What You'll Learn

The guide section covers:

- **Architecture** — Understanding hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters) and how Spring-Hex implements domain-driven design patterns
- **Configuration** — Complete reference for the `.hex/config.yml` file and package resolution strategies
- **CQRS Pattern** — Implementing Command Query Responsibility Segregation with the mediator pattern
- **Database Migrations** — Working with Flyway and Liquibase for version-controlled database changes
- **Testing** — Generating and running feature tests and unit tests

These guides assume you have already installed Spring-Hex and completed the Quick Start tutorial. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Installation]({% link getting-started/installation.md %}) and [Quick Start]({% link getting-started/quick-start.md %}) sections first.

Each guide is self-contained and can be read independently, though we recommend reading the Architecture guide first to understand the foundational concepts.
